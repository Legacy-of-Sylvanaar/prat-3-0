# Prat-3.0

Prat-3.0 is a chat enhancement addon for world of warcraft.

It is made up of 30+ smaller "modules" which each provide additional functionality, and can be enabled or disabled individually.

In game, type /prat for a menu.

Prat has just about every feature you can think of, and then some. Really. When I get some more time, I'll try and put together a full list (Even I have lost count)

(Thanks to Dreamsight for this partial list)

*   Change arrows, buttons, mouse scroll for chat scroll, scroll speed
*   you can add color per channel, color per lvl, color per class
*   timestamps
*   timestamp color
*   whether to show timestamp (what format the timestamp should be in)
*   whether to show players lvl
*   you can select the option for channel "stickys" (last channel you used you auto use when hitting enter, that sort of thing – or last thing someone said)
*   change the looks of the chat's editbox - as well as where it appears (you can even undock it and move it to where you'd like it to be)
*   chat fading, fading delay
*   You can change the font to a list of fonts, add an outline to it, monochrome it (if you don’t mind messing with files a bit you could prolly even add other fonts to that list)

Its predecessor, Prat-2.0 has been around since the TBC release in 2006. This new version seeks to improve upon some aspects such as memory use, but still do so without creating 30+ small folders in your addon directory that you have to manage.

While trying to reduce resource utilization, it is also important to note that some people prefer the features, and don't care that an addon uses 500k more. I have been trying to isolate the most resource intensive functionality into the Prat\_HighCPUUSageModules folder. You can enable or disable it per your preference.
